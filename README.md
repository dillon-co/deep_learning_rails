# HOW TO BEGIN

clone this repo.


## Training


open a console, run the command `DigitRecognizer.new.train_and_save_model`

then watch it train! You should expect to see `accuracy: ~0.95` which is 95% accuracy.

if it's anything less than 90 something's wrong.

## Running.
Then just run your rails server and navigate to the home page. Upload an MNIST image of 1
digit and watch it classify it
